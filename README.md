# DSA Practice – C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms practice** implemented in C++.  
It covers core topics frequently used in programming interviews and academic projects.

---

## Topics Covered

- **Linked List** – Singly linked list implementation  
- **Doubly Linked List** – Implementation with forward and backward traversal  
- **Deque** – Double-ended queue operations  
- **Queue** – Standard queue implementation  
- **Stack** – LIFO stack operations  
- **Sort Algorithms** – Basic sorting algorithms like bubble, selection, insertion

---

## Purpose

- To strengthen my **problem-solving and algorithmic skills**  
- To get hands-on experience with **C++ data structures**  
- To prepare for **coding interviews and academic assignments**

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
