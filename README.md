# C++ DSA Practice

This repository contains my **structured practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++**.  
All data structures are implemented **from scratch** to strengthen core concepts and prepare for coding interviews.

---

##  Purpose
- Deep dive and revision of DSA concepts
- Practice clean and efficient C++ implementations
- Build strong problem-solving foundations
- Maintain a single reference repo for DSA in C++

---

##  Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stack (Array & Linked List)
- Queue (Simple, Circular, Deque)

---

##  How to Run
Compile and run any file individually:

```
g++ filename.cpp
./a.out
```
